# Simple String toolkit
=======================
Simple String toolkit is a Qt-based GUI program to manipulate some simple String tasks. The focused platform is Linux, but you can compile it (using Qt Creator) in many platform. The functionalites are very simple, nothing special at all.

I just learned Qt for less than a week, so this is my very first project i made, so except bugs.
