# Simple String toolkit
=======================
Simple String toolkit is a Qt-based GUI program to manipulate some simple String tasks. The focused platform is Linux, but you can compile it (using Qt Creator) in many platform. The functionalites are very simple, nothing special at all.

I just learned Qt for less than a week, so this is my very first project i made, so except bugs or tell me about it. Thanks in advance.

## Features:
===========
> ### Hashing:
>> Implemented some common hashing functions: MD 2/4/5,SHA1,SHA 224/256/384/512,SHA3 224/256/384/512, CRC16/32,ALDER32,WHIRLPOOL512, RIPEMD 128/160/256/320,...
>
> ### Encoding:
>> Some Basic String function: Base32/Base64 Encoding/Decoding, ASCII to Hex (Base 16 number), Hex to ASCII, ASCII to Dec (Base 10 Number), Dec to ASCII, ASCII to Binary (Base 2 number), Binary to ASCII, ASCII to Morse Code, Morse Code to ASCII, Reverse String....
>
> ### Ceasar Solver:
>>Increase Step, Decrease Step to get out the plain text for Ceasar Cipher, or make Ciphered Text
>
> ### Some more features I want to add:
>> - Encryption/Decryption using common Cryptographic Algorithms: AES, DES, RSA, ECC, Blowfish, RC4, etc,....
>> - String Pattern Generator
>> - Brute-Forcing Ability
>> ---A Simple Ceasar/Vigenere Solver---
>> - ....

## Requires:
============
> - Qt 5.x
> - C++ Compiler

## How to Compile
=================
> - Clone the git repository to your computer
> - Move to the folder and use "make" command
> That's all
