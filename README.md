# Simple String toolkit
=======================
Simple String toolkit is a Qt-based GUI program to manipulate some simple String tasks. The focused platform is Linux, but you can compile it (using Qt Creator) in many platform. The functionalites are very simple, nothing special at all.

I just learned Qt for less than a week, so this is my very first project i made, so except bugs.

# Features:
===========
> ## Hashing:
>> Implemented some common hashing functions: MD 2/4/5,SHA1,SHA 224/256/384/512,SHA3 224/256/384/512, CRC16/32,ALDER32,WHIRLPOOL512, RIPEMD 128/160/256/320,...
>
> ## Encoding:
>> Some Basic String function: Base64 Encoding/Decoding, ASCII to Hex (Base 16 number, Hex to ASCII, ASCII to Dec(Base 10 Number), Dec to ASCII, ASCII to Binary (Base 2 number), Reverse String,Base32 Encoding/Decoding....
>
> ##Some more features I want to add:
>> - Encryption/Decryption using cryptography
>> - String Pattern Generator
>> - Brute-Forcing Ability
>> - A Simple Ceasar/Vigenere Solver
>> - ....

Just a hobby project in my free time, these lines are for some lawers if they need it. 

This project uses Lib Crypto++ to manipulate most of the functions.
